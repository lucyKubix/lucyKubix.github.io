## Branch

All branches have a specific naming convention - ‘CU-’ followed by the ClickUp ID, then the developers name and then a very brief summary of the task.
For example ‘CU-8698zh3cc_Mell-Russon-swatch-fix’.

The best way to keep this consistent is to use the Github extension in ClickUp, as this generates the branch name for you, without the summary, and allows the branch to be linked to the task so if another developer has to pick up the work then they have the branch name available at a quick glance.

Always make sure that you select the correct repository and branch from main unless specified otherwise which should only be in very rare cases.

Keep branch summaries short and functional — focus on the action (e.g., header-fix, cart-bug, product-layout).

Never branch from another developer’s feature branch unless explicitly instructed.
