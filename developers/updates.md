## Updates

As a mostly remote team, the way we do updates is a key part of knowing where everyone is at with their workload and making sure PMs are up to date with progress on their tasks to keep the clients informed.

To help keep on top of things and making sure everyone is getting the support they need we have daily morning standups to go over everyone’s day, ask any questions and just generally making sure everyone knows what they’re doing. We also have daily evening washups. Both of these calls are mandatory.

On responding to tasks use screen recordings or Looms inside ClickUp tasks when explaining complex logic or front-end behaviour and tag your PM when a review is needed so the task doesn’t sit idle. Within the store support channel, there is a response template which is to be followed where possible.
